## Introduction
Azure Machine Learning Service is a powerful platform for building, training, and deploying machine learning models. This repository aims to centralize useful scripts and templates that can be reused across projects.

## Scripts and Templates
The following scripts and templates are planned for inclusion in this repository (work in progress):

1. **Model Deployment**:
   - PowerShell script for deploying a trained model to an Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) cluster.
   - Template for creating an AKS cluster with AML integration.

2. **Data Preparation**:
   - Script for automating data preprocessing tasks (e.g., cleaning, feature engineering).
   - Template for setting up data pipelines using Azure Data Factory.

3. **Workspace Management**:
   - Script for creating an AML workspace.
   - Template for provisioning associated resources (e.g., storage, key vault).

## Prerequisites
Before using these scripts, ensure the following prerequisites are met:
1. **Azure Subscription**: Sign up for an Azure account if you don't have one.
2. **Azure CLI**: Install the Azure Command-Line Interface (CLI) on your system.
3. **Azure Machine Learning Workspace**: Set up an AML workspace within your Azure subscription.

## Usage
1. Clone this repository or download the relevant scripts.
2. Modify the scripts to match your specific use case (e.g., update resource names, paths).
3. Execute the scripts using PowerShell.

## Contributing
Contributions are welcome! If you have additional scripts or improvements, feel free to submit pull requests.
